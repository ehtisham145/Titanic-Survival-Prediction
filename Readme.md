Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using Machine Learning techniques.
It is based on the famous Kaggle Titanic dataset, which contains demographic and travel information of passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and family details.

The goal of this project is to:

Analyze the dataset.

Build a predictive model.

Evaluate its accuracy and performance.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy (Data Analysis)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (Development Environment)

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains details of 891 passengers from the Titanic.
Important features include:

Pclass (Ticket class)

Sex

Age

SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)

Parch (Parents/Children aboard)

Fare

Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

Target column:

Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🚀 Model Training

Data cleaning (handling missing values).

Feature engineering (encoding categorical variables, scaling).

Model building using:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

✅ Results

Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.

Random Forest performed best among tested models.

📌 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:your-username/Titanic-Survival-Prediction.git
cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Jupyter Notebook or Python script:

jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic.ipynb

🔮 Future Improvements

Try deep learning models.

Use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).

Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit.
